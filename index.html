					<h3>Which data platform is right for me?</h3>
					
					<p>The website <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking">DB-Engines</a> keeps track of over 350 different data platform technologies, ranging from relational databases to data warehouses, document databases, key-value stores, search engines, time series, graph databases, and more.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/motivation.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					
					<p>My goals in this talk:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Walk you through several scenarios.</li>
						<li>Discuss when different data storage types make sense.</li>
						<li>Cover relevant cloud options in AWS and Azure.</li>
						<li>Describe technologies for integrating everything together.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/caution.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>A Brief Warning</h3>
					
					<p>This talk covers data platform technologies as a broad swath and does not spend much time covering the merits of individual products with respect to one another.</p>

					<p>Often times, "the platform you have" is a perfectly reasonable answer for "Which platform should I choose?"  Understanding how (and when!) to use these platforms is my goal for today.</p>

					<h3>Our Scenario</h3>
					
					<p>We work for Catallaxy Widgets, a major retailer of fine widgets and widget accessories.  Our holdings include hundreds of stores around the world, as well as a major website.</p>

					<p>Our IT team is looking to modernize several key systems in the organization and asked for our guidance.</p>
				</section>

					<h3>The Current System</h3>

				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/ugh.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Pain Points</h3>
					
					<p>Our current system has worked, but we're experiencing some pain points:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Finances in Excel spreadsheets is clunky.</li>
						<li>Customers experience slowness searching through our vast product catalog.</li>
						<li>Customers experience slowness navigating through our website and making orders.</li>
						<li>No support for the data science team.</li>
						<li>Log review is painful for IT.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/telephones.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>The Upshot</h3>
					
					<p>For each of these problem domains, we will look at data platform technologies well-suited for the domain.</p>

					<p>Not all of these technologies are necessary and we can certainly make substitutions, but these are solid choices for the job.</p>

					<h3>Key Requirements</h3>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Data MUST be correct.  Eventual consistency and even a few missed records won't work for us.</li>
						<li>Systems should be easy for non-IT staff to access, ideally within Excel.</li>
						<li>It's okay for some reports to update nightly rather than real-time.  We also need a real-time app AP and AR can use for their day-to-day work.</li>
						<li>Performance is less important than correctness, but still a factor.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/circuitboards.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Key Technologies</h3>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Relational database (OLTP -- On-Line Transactional Processing) for storing financial data.</li>
						<li>Relational database (OLAP -- On-Line Analytical Processing) for connectivity to Excel and reviewing results.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>Why OLTP?</h3>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Non-distributed, relational database because the data must be correct for everybody, and ACID compliance helps us considerably.</li>
						<li>Performance will generally be good, though analysts far from the data center may need to deal with slower queries.</li>
					</ul>

				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>Why OLAP?</h3>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Specifically, the Kimball model for warehousing.</li>
						<li>The data must be correct but may be delayed.  We can use an ETL process to populate the warehouse.</li>
						<li>Data marts may be distributed across the globe to meet the performance needs of analysts, along with a central data warehouse to store the full set of data.</li>
						<li>Excel tools like Power Query are designed to work with Kimball-style warehouses.</li>
					</ul>

				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>OLTP + OLAP</h3>
					
					<p>Relational databases can serve as either OLTP or OLAP--these are database designs rather than distinct technologies.</p>

					<p>There are also technologies dedicated to extending beyond relational OLAP, such as SQL Server Analysis Services and Oracle Essbase.</p>

					<h3>What is a Document DB?</h3>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Key-value store</li>
						<li>The value is a complex document, often JSON (or JSON-like)</li>
						<li>The value may be nested:  <code>Product</code> has <code>Images</code>, <code>PriceChanges</code>, and <code>StoreAvailability</code> as well as attributes like <code>Price</code>, <code>Title</code>, and <code>Brand</code></li>
						<li>Data retrieval is typically one record at a time, but allows for scans of data</li>

					<h3>Is OLTP Necessary Here?</h3>
					
					<p>Short answer:  no.</p>

					<p>Long answer:  an OLTP database may be a good choice for a busy product catalog, as it gives you a correct source system and it allows you to "true up" the document database(s).</p>

					<h3>A Note on Shopping Carts</h3>
					
					<p>I'd recommend using an OLTP system for the shopping cart unless your company is enormous like Amazon.</p>

					<p>If you do get to that point, a key-value store or document database can work well for the shopping cart, but be sure to have post-order mechanisms to ensure that products are available, prices were correct, the method of billing was successful, etc.  Use message brokers to split apart these systems.</p>

					<h3>Roll Your Own or Purchase?</h3>
					
					<p>There are full-service logging solutions, such as Splunk, Datadog, Loggly, and SumoLogic.  These products perform quite well and tend to be accessible for developers and administrators.  The downside is that they tend to be quite expensive.</p>

					<p>On the other side, open source products exist as well and can be quite powerful when used correctly, but the learning curve tends to be much higher.</p>

					<h3>Data on the Move</h3>
					
					<p>As soon as you have two data platform systems, you introduce the need to combine data.</p>

					<p>There are three major approaches to data movement:  ETL, ELT, and Data Virtualization.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/spiral-staircase.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>ETL to ELT</h3>
					
					<p>For a long time, the normal pattern for data movement was Extract-Transform-Load (ETL).  With the massive increase in data sizes, we have seen a move toward Extract-Load-Transform (ELT).</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>ETL to ELT:  the Difference</h3>
					
					<p>ETL modifies data during the movement process:  Extract data from a system, Transform it in the mover, and then Load the resulting data into your destination.</p>

					<p>By contrast, with ELT, we Extract data from a system, Load it into a staging area on the destination, and Transform the data into its final form using the destination's compute resources.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>Data Virtualization</h3>
					
					<p>In addition to moving data from system to system, we can <strong>virtualize</strong> data, making it appear to move while remaining in its current location.  Virtualization tools are commonly third-party products which sit on top of several data platform technologies and offer a "single pane of glass" view of databases.  Functionality typically includes the ability to join between sources.</p>

					<p>The downside to virtualization is that performance typically suffers with larger sets of data.</p>

						<li>Denodo</li>
						<li>IBM Cloud Pak</li>
						<li>Informatica PowerCenter</li>

					<h3>PolyBase</h3>
					
					<p>SQL Server 2019 extends a Microsoft technology called PolyBase, which allows you to virtualize data from a number of different data platform technologies, including Hadoop, Azure Blob Storage, SQL Server, Oracle, MongoDB, Cosmos DB, Spark, DB/2, Excel, and more.</p>

					<p>For more, go to <a href="https://csmore.info/on/polybase">https://csmore.info/on/polybase</a>.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>PolyBase and ELT</h3>
					
					<p>One difference between PolyBase and other data virtualization products is that PolyBase enables ELT into SQL Server.  You can create an external table from a remote data source and use that to land data into SQL Server.</p>
