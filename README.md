# The Curated Data Platform

This repository holds the slides for my presentation entitled [The Curated Data Platform](https://www.catallaxyservices.com/presentations/curated-data-platform/).

The accompanying code in the `code\` folder uses the [diagrams](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/) Python package to generate the diagrams I use in the talk. There is no sample code of how to install, configure, or query various data platform technologies.
